## Introduction: Why we chose this topic

### A short introduction on why our topic is interesting

We took the class on Innovation & Networks, and we both where really intrigued by the model on indirect network effects in the 
search engine market. We then wondered if we could apply this model to other markets as well, for example the social media market. 
In the search engine market, prufer expects that there will be only 1 monopolist over time, due to heavy network effects of this market.
We expect this same type of monopoly will result in the social media market. 


We were wondering if the proposition of data sharing, as proposed by prufer to solve the search engine monopoly result, is


Optional: (In the paper by prufer, they propose data sharing to prevent a monopolist from arising in the market, and blocking new 
access. We are interested to see if we can modify this proposition for the social media market as well, making sure no monopolist 
can arise in this market.)

### The method we use to answer our research question

First show how theory predicts triopoly case and duopoly case in a cournot market.

Then use these models in combinations with our own model.


Give the answer that you find.

Mention the main assumptions that you
need to get this answer.

That social media depend a lot on (indirect)
network effects, and that we can compare them with a search engine market.

When you use information,
create a link to this information. The reader then only needs to click to find
the relevant information.If you use data, present
graphs of the data.If you use equations, use
latex to make them easy to read. Explain your code, the
reader must be able to easily follow what you are doing.Present a clear conclusion/answer to your
question.Programming is great to
do sensitivity analysis, just to the same you did before, but now with
different parameter values.Include some discussion of what you
find and elements on which you need additional information.To increase readability,
use internal links. E.g. when you refer to the conclusion, create a link to it
so that the reader can quickly glance what you have done and go back to where
she/he was reading. For this to work, you need to export the notebook to html.
You do not have to do this, but it will impress us if you manage it.
